# Victoria's MangoWM Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles for a [mango](https://github.com/mangowm/mango) (dwl-based Wayland compositor) desktop — Waybar, a full Wayland utility stack, GRUB theming, and an installer that adapts itself to your distro, your init system, and your hardware.

## Features

- **Window manager:** [mango](https://github.com/mangowm/mango) — a dwl-based Wayland compositor
- **Status bar:** Waybar, with a CPU temperature sensor auto-detected on install, a live tags module read straight from mango's own IPC, MPRIS media controls, and a calendar popup
- **App launcher:** rofi, plus fuzzel for the clipboard picker
- **Clipboard manager:** cliphist
- **Notifications & OSD:** swaync for notifications, swayosd for on-screen volume/brightness feedback
- **Screenshots:** grim + slurp
- **Logout menu:** wlogout, themed
- **Wallpaper:** waypaper (SUPER+F), with a bundled fallback wallpaper for the first boot
- **Multi-monitor:** kanshi — your connected outputs are detected automatically and written into a profile using each display's native (i.e. maximum) resolution and refresh rate, no hardcoded numbers
- **Keyboard layout:** picked from a short menu during install and applied both to mango (`xkb_rules_layout`/`xkb_rules_variant`) and to the raw console (`/etc/vconsole.conf`), so it's consistent whether you're at a bare TTY or inside the graphical session
- **GTK theming:** Materia-dark applied the same way `nwg-look` would (gtk-3.0/gtk-4.0 `settings.ini`, `~/.gtkrc-2.0`, `GTK_THEME` env var)
- **Shell:** fish, with the greeting disabled and fastfetch shown on every new terminal
- **Terminal:** kitty
- **Cursor theme:** Animated-Mew-Cursor
- **Bootloader theming (optional):** UltraGrub GRUB theme, plus a patch that cleans up boot entries (e.g. tidies the Windows entry for dual-boot)
- **Display manager (optional):** [ly](https://github.com/fairyglade/ly), set up so Mango is the only session in the list
- **Discord screen sharing** wired up correctly (`--ozone-platform=wayland` + PipeWire capturer) wherever Discord gets launched from

### The installer

- **Multi-distro:** Arch/Artix/CachyOS/EndeavourOS (pacman), Fedora (dnf, best-effort), and NixOS (writes a config snippet instead of installing anything imperatively, since that's not how NixOS works)
- **Init-system aware:** detects systemd / OpenRC / dinit and sets up `elogind` for seat management automatically when you're not on systemd
- **Adds Arch's own repos when it makes sense:** on an Arch-based distro that doesn't already ship Arch's `[core]`/`[extra]` (e.g. Artix — CachyOS/EndeavourOS already have them, so this is a no-op there), offers to add them with a mirrorlist matched to your existing region
- **`--dry-run`:** shows every command and file change it would make without touching your system
- **Doesn't nag for your password 20 times:** asks once up front and keeps the sudo session alive for the rest of the run
- **Safe to re-run:** already-installed packages and already-applied fixes are skipped, not repeated

## Requirements

Pick whichever matches your system — the installer detects it automatically:

- **Arch-based:** Arch, Artix, CachyOS, EndeavourOS, or any other pacman-based distro, plus `git`. An AUR helper (`yay` or `paru`) is offered automatically if neither is found.
- **Fedora:** a recent release with `dnf` and `git`. Package coverage here is best-effort — anything that fails to install is reported at the end instead of silently breaking the run.
- **NixOS:** any recent generation. The installer writes a config snippet instead of installing packages; you add it to your flake/configuration.nix and rebuild yourself.

## How to install?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kohagizpk/victoria-mangowm-dotfiles.git
cd victoria-mangowm-dotfiles
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Want to see what it would do first, without changing anything?

```bash
./install.sh --dry-run
```

The script is interactive: it walks you through a few quick choices up front (keyboard layout, and an AUR helper if you don't have one), shows a summary of everything it's about to do, and only then asks you to confirm and starts working. Here's the gist of what happens, in order:

1. Checks you have an internet connection and aren't running as root.
2. Detects your distro family and, on Arch-based systems, your init system — asking only if it can't tell.
3. Asks for your keyboard layout once, up front.
4. Asks for your sudo password once, and keeps the session alive for the rest of the run instead of prompting repeatedly.
5. On an Arch-based distro without Arch's own `[core]`/`[extra]` repos (Artix, mainly), offers to add them with a mirrorlist matched to your region.
6. Installs everything: the compositor, Waybar, launchers, portals, the PipeWire audio stack, GTK theming, fonts (including real Nerd Font icon glyphs, even on Fedora where the packaged font doesn't have them), and bundled apps.
7. Deploys the dotfiles to `~/.config/mango` and patches the handful of things that don't work as committed — wrong paths after folder renames, commands left over from a different compositor, a keybind that outlived the package it referred to, that sort of thing. Every patch is logged and printed in the summary at the end.
8. Auto-detects your CPU temperature sensor and your connected monitors, and wires both into the config with no hardcoded values.
9. Sets up the display manager (`ly`), the cursor theme, and — optionally — the GRUB theme, your default shell, and the `video` group permission brightness control needs.
10. Runs a health check at the end and tells you plainly if anything's missing.

## Known issues

- `config/Animated-Mew-Cursor/index.theme` and `cursor.theme` are currently saved as rich-text documents instead of plain text (probably edited in a word processor by accident). The actual cursor files still work, but GTK apps may not list the theme correctly until these two are re-saved as plain text.
- Two `mousebind=NONE,...` lines for `btn_left`/`btn_right` in `config.conf` are commented out by the installer — mango can't bind those two buttons with no modifier at all (a known upstream limitation, not a config mistake). Both actions already have working keybinds elsewhere (`ALT+Tab`, `SUPER+Q`).
- `install.sh` may still not behave perfectly on every machine — read its output carefully, it logs every adaptation it makes, and it's always safe to run again.
